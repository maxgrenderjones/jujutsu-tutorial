# How to install `jj`

This tutorial is written when `jj` is at version 0.23.0. It may work for
later versions, but you also may need to adapt.

For the full range of ways to install `jj`, you can visit the [Installation and
Setup][install] page of the official documentation. Personally, because I am
a Rust developer, and `jj` is written in Rust, I installed my copy like this:

[install]: https://martinvonz.github.io/jj/v0.23.0/install-and-setup/

```console
$ cargo install jj-cli@0.23.0 --locked
```

If you're not a Rust developer, please read the documentation to figure out how
to install things on your platform; I could replicate that information here,
but I'm not going to waste your time.
